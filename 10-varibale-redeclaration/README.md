### Redeclaration

- atleast one variable in the short declaration should be a new variable.
- view the [redeclaration-example](https://github.com/akashdgo/udemy_learngo/blob/master/10-varibale-redeclaration/example/main.go)

### variable declaration vs short declaration

|variable|short|
|---|---|
|if initi value not known|if the init value is known|
|when var for pkg scoped variable|   |
|when req to *group var* for *readability*|   |
|   |use to keep code concise|
|   |when it is required to declare and assign value to a variable|
|   |can be created in 'if' statements belonging to that statement only|
