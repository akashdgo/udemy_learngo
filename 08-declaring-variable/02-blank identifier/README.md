## Unused Variables
-------------------

- all variable declared should be used else it will give an error.
- for avoiding maintaince nightmare.
- block scope variable needs to be used without fail.
- package scope variable might not be used inside the package but might be used by a different package and so no error is returned.

`**unused variable is only for block scope variable.**`

- blank-identifier is like an null interface or a black-hole.
