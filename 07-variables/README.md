### Variable
------------

- variables are stored in memory
- variable are only created when the program is run (variable become alive during runtime and not during compile time)
------------

#### Basic data types
---------------------

int : variable without fraction 
- can be negative or positive
- the value is called integer literals

`literal - just the value itself`

```
e.g   
                    integer literal
                    ---------------
int    --------->   -1    0     32
```
- variable has a name but a literal has a value
-----------------
float64 - has a fractional part

```
e.g   
                         float literal
                         --------------
float64   --------->     -.5    0.     32.
                     ==> -0.5   0.0    32.0
```
-------------

```
e.g   
                    pre-decalared constants
                    ------------------------
bool   --------->   true               false
```
<--  the values are just `names`

-----------------
```
e.g   
                    string literals
                    ---------------
string   ---------> "Hi there आकाश"
```
<-- non-english char are represented as utf-8 (unicode characters) in which each code can take 1-4 bytes
